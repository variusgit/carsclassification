# Cars classification two jupyter notebooks
## ðŸ’¡ All info is based on surveillance pard of cars dataset found by [CompCars dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/datasets/comp_cars/index.html)
* CarsModelClassification.ipynb - model is based on EfficientNetB0 model with changed layers (details are inside), the purpose is to predict MODEL of car
* CarsMultiLabelClassification.ipynb - model contains of two pards, first part is based on EfficientNetB0 for car's MODEL prediction and second part repeating TinyVGG architecture to predict car's color (details are also inside)
